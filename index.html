                    <p>In nearly every region of the world, the border collie is now also a breed that is shown in a ring or bench shows. 
                        For the people who participate in these events, the Border Collie is defined by the breed standard, which is a 
                        description of how the dog should look. In New Zealand and Australia, where the breed has been shown throughout 
                        most of the twentieth century, the Border Collie standards have produced a dog with a long double coat 
                        (smooth coats are allowed), a soft dark eye, a body slightly longer than tall, a well-defined stop, semi-pricked ears, 
                        as well as a gentle and friendly temperament. This style of Border Collie has become popular in winning show kennels 
                        around the world, as well as among prestigious judges. Breed standards state that its tail must be slightly curved 
                        and must stop at the hock. The fur must be lush. It should show good expression in its eyes and must be intelligent. 
                        It is energetic with most commonly a black and white coat (sometimes brown). It should have a powerful herding instinct.</p>
